## Focus on privacy and sharing data with known people

This project is designed to share images via a social network. It started with using services that are more traditional â€” a DB and blob host, + UCANs for ID.

In the interest of dogfood though, I've realized that what I'm really looking for is a small scale way to share images with specific people, and I've discovered that [wnfs](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/file-system-wnfs) already has a way to do read permissions on a per-user basis. That's kind of interesting because it's all based on decryption capabilities instead of access control.

And `wnfs` gives us a common backend / ID-source for users, which makes identity easier, since your ID cannot be cross-domain.

> to share private files with a group of people, you would need to write down the list of people in the group. Then call `fs.sharePrivate` and pass it the list of other users.

So `wnfs` I think has everything needed for this usecase. At this point it's more a matter of finding time to try this & build some UI for it.

## notes
The `events` module is required by our dependencies. It wasn't included so we have added it here.
