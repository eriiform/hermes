**Inviting Others (Option 1)**
- Hermes asks permission for searching contacts and showing you who in your contacts has Hermes, and also invites your contacts to join

problem: is this a privacy risk?
can we delete the info after? This becomes an issue of trust.

**Inviting Others (Option 2)**
- Hermes composes and invite text to Hermes or to be your friend through the platform and user must then copy that to their messages/email and invites people manually
