Hermes is an application for photo sharing, that offers fully private and encrypted communication.

As a local-first, privancy focused app, there are UX decisions that are not relevant to most mainstream applications. Like for example, has my data synchronized with a server, or is it only hosted locally? How much data do I want to host locally? When is it ok to stop hosting locally -- after it is replicated to 1 server or more than 1?
