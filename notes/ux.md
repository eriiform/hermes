**Inviting Others (Option 1)**
- Hermes asks permission for searching contacts and showing you who in your contacts has Hermes, and also invites your contacts to join

problem: is this a privacy risk?
can we delete the info after? This becomes an issue of trust.

**Inviting Others (Option 2)**
- Hermes composes and invite text to Hermes or to be your friend through the platform and user must then copy that to their messages/email and invites people manually

**Inviting Others (Option 3)**
- a text or email is sent with url
- url contains query string:
includes inviter’s profile url (browser) for both desktop and mobile
then prompts you to create an account and directs you to user

- problem: urls use a browser, so then you would have to redesign for desktop browser, if that person were to go use link with desktop
- with an encrypted app the potential user cannot see the entire landscape of Hermes, like the feed and other options. they just see the profile

- problem: encryption is forgone, since essentially urls cannot be encrypted. there would need to be two coded Hermes (one encrypted with auth and one without) 
- this opens up new risk
- also defeats the purpose of privacy and original encryption - ppl can easily gain access to texts or emails. 

- problem: the original problem of how to send invite still exists

- question: what’s the reason someone would use an encrypted app and make their profile public, if not for just finding and inviting their friends?
- “going public” will have a different meaning. Here it means anyone who has url can see your photos and profile.
